* About this Software

clj-span is an implementation of the Service Path Attribution Networks
(Springer LNCS 2010 - Johnson et al.) framework for Ecosystem Service
Assessment.

Using clj-span, you can run a collection of parameterizable SPAN flow
simulation models (line-of-sight, proximity, carbon, flood-water,
surface-water, sediment, coastal-storm-protection, and
subsistence-fisheries) and visualize their results as map outputs.

* Usage

To run clj-span, you will need:

1) Sun's JDK 1.7+
2) clj-span-standalone.jar (contains clojure-1.5.1)

Then simply place clj-span-standalone.jar on your classpath and fire
up your JVM as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

java -cp clj-span-standalone.jar clj_span.commandline \
     -config-file        <filepath>                 \
     -source-layer       <filepath>                 \
     -sink-layer         <filepath>                 \
     -use-layer          <filepath>                 \
     -flow-layers        <filepath>                 \
     -source-threshold   <double>                   \
     -sink-threshold     <double>                   \
     -use-threshold      <double>                   \
     -trans-threshold    <double>                   \
     -cell-width         <double>                   \
     -cell-height        <double>                   \

     -sink-type          <finite|infinite>          \
     -use-type           <finite|infinite>          \
     -benefit-type       <rival|non-rival>          \
